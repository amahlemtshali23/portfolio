POOL HOUSE BLURB: 

The brief of this project was to design a pool house for a client on the south side of the pool. They are tight on a budget. Therefore the structure may not exceed 36mÂ². The pool house should include two change rooms, a covered outdoor bar area & built-in braai. One of the client's children has grown up and is attending university. They would like to extend the pool house to include an upstairs apartment. The pool house should be left unchanged and provide an outside staircase up to the first-floor apartment. The apartment must include a seating area, kitchenette, sleeping and studying area and a bathroom.


LUXURY SUITE: 

A five-star South African hotel group is planning to build a new business hotel in a major city centre. The brief required us to document technical mock-ups for a new luxury suite, specifically emphasising the bathroom details. A luxury suite usually includes a bedroom and an area with a kitchenette. The room must adhere to the five-star rating requirements. The luxury suite should include an entrance lobby, lounge/dining room, bedroom, dressing area and bathroom. 

BA BAR: 

Upon completing the design work of the Ba Brew Pub, we were required to document the technical drawing set that one would require if one wished to complete this build, in its entirety.
